# Contributing to HomeTube

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **HomeTube**! üôå  
Pull Requests (PRs) are welcome, but please note:

üëâ **No direct collaborators are added to the repository.**  
All contributions must go through the PR review process from your fork, and final merge decisions are made by the maintainer.

## üß≠ Philosophy

HomeTube‚Äôs goal is to stay **simple, robust, and privacy-respectful** ‚Äî a unified downloader built on `yt-dlp`, with a clean UI, strong resilience, and minimal dependencies.

Please keep contributions aligned with this philosophy.

**Priorities:**
- Stability > Features
- Simplicity > Complexity
- Clarity > Cleverness
- Security > Convenience

## üí° General Contribution Rules

1. **Open an Issue first**  
   - Describe the motivation and intended scope before opening a PR.  
   - Large or experimental ideas should be discussed before implementation.

2. **Scope matters**  
   - Prefer small, self-contained PRs (1 feature/fix per PR).  
   - Avoid large refactors unless discussed first.

3. **Optional by default**  
   - Any external integration (e.g., Jellyfin, Plex, etc.) must be **disabled by default** and configurable via environment variables.

4. **Security & reliability**  
   - No hard-coded secrets, tokens, or credentials.  
   - Use timeouts, retries, and non-blocking error handling for all network calls.

5. **Keep dependencies minimal**  
   - Every new dependency must be justified and lightweight.  
   - Prefer Python stdlib whenever possible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Guidelines

- **Python**: version 3.11+  
- **Linting**: `ruff` + `black`  
- **Tests**: `pytest -m "not slow and not external and not network"` must pass.  
- **Typing**: gradual adoption of type hints is encouraged.  
- **Configuration**: use environment variables defined in `config.py` (no global hard-coded constants).  
- **Logging**: human-readable, actionable messages.  

---

## üß© Integrations (e.g., Jellyfin, Plex, etc.)

If you propose an external service integration:

- Place it under `integrations/<service>.py`.
- Must be **disabled by default** (`SERVICE_ENABLED=false`).
- Use env vars:
  ```
  JELLYFIN_ENABLED=false
  JELLYFIN_URL=https://your-server
  JELLYFIN_API_KEY=...
  JELLYFIN_TIMEOUT=5
  JELLYFIN_RETRIES=2
  ```
- Add `timeout`, `retry`, and logging (non-blocking on errors).
- Include minimal tests and documentation section in `README.md`.

---

## üß™ Testing

- Add at least one unit or integration test for new logic.  
- Use reduced sample JSON fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`.  
- Do not commit large files (>1 MB).  
- CI must stay fast and reproducible.

---

## üßæ Commit & PR Guidelines

- **Fork the repository first** ‚Äî all PRs must come from your fork, not from a branch in this repo.
- **Commit messages**: use imperative mood ‚Äî e.g. `Add`, `Fix`, `Refactor`.  
- **PR titles**: concise and descriptive (`Add Jellyfin trigger integration`).  
- **Description**: explain the motivation, scope, and limitations.  
- The maintainer may **squash-merge** your PR into a single clean commit.

Example PR checklist:
```
- [ ] Minimal, focused scope
- [ ] Optional by default (if integration)
- [ ] Non-blocking on errors
- [ ] Tests added / updated
- [ ] Lint & formatting pass
- [ ] README or docs updated
```

---

## üîê Security

- Never submit API keys, cookies, or tokens.  
- No credentials in code or commits.  
- Report security concerns privately by emailing the maintainer or creating a private security advisory on GitHub.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Governance

- **Maintainer:** single owner responsible for merges, releases, and roadmap decisions.  
- **Contributions:** via PRs only, from forks (no direct push access).  
- **Collaborators:** not accepted ‚Äî all contributors work from their own forks.  
- **Merges:** squash-merge for a clean history.  
- **Versioning:** [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/).  
  - Breaking changes bump the major version.
